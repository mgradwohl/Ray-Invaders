# Ray Invaders

This is a port of kofybrek's SFML Space Invaders to raylib. I'll also make it more object oriented and do some performance profiling and clean up the code.

To get this working:
1. Install raylib from raylib.com to the default directory
2. Open the raylib VS2022 project and build the release and debug libs for your platform (mine is x64)
3. close the raylib project
4. Sync the Ray-Invaders repro
5. Open the sln, build and have fun
