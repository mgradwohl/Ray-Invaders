CompileFlags:
  Add:
    - "-std=c++23"
    - "-I/usr/local/include"
    - "-I."

# Prefer using the CMake-generated compilation database for accurate includes.
CompilationDatabase:
  Directory: "build/vs-clangpp/debug"

# Note: do not hard-code a raylib include path here. Configure the project
# using the CMake presets (which set RAYLIB_ROOT) so CMake regenerates
# compile_commands.json with the correct include directories for clangd.
